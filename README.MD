#Web playgrounds for static sites.

I got tired of having to create folder structures and all that in order to
create a playground. Im just gonna fork this whenever I want to play with web stuff.

<pre>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</pre>

This has most of what I typically use. jQuery and lodash. But I guess I can have
a 'simple' fork without any bells/whistles. Then a gh-pages fork that points to
playgrounds that I deem important enough to move into their own thing?

Sure why not.
